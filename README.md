# Camera-App
This camera app captures photos from the mobile's front-facing lens and can upload photos from the gallery. And can crop &amp; rotate captured photos and uploaded images from the gallery.
Libraries I have used in this project is :
a. CameraX : To get image on the display and to capture the image in high-quality.
b. Android-Image-Cropper : To crop or rotate the images.
